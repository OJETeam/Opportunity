[FIX]
	Deeply nested child-parent system is not working correctly
	Window resize
	UpdateModel
	Check all TODO comments (after first prototype)
	add RemoveParent function
	Creating objects. Objects created locally are deleted. Manipulating them using solely pointers is inconvenient
	SORT FILES TO FOLDERS
	fix the damn naming convention. Stop calling funtions in random styles

[IDEAS]
	Implement unit that can move in any direction, not only relative to its rotation
	Transform class like in Unity3D?
	SWITCH ENGINE TO COMPONENT SYSTEM?

[Test]
	Scale objects
